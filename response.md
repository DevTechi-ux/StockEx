I have updated the active trades tables to be responsive to different screen sizes. I have hidden some of the less important columns on smaller screens to make the tables easier to read on mobile devices. 

Specifically, I have made changes to the following files:
- `src/components/Admin/Trade/ActiveTrades.tsx`
- `src/components/Admin/NiftyUpDown/ActiveTrade.tsx`

These changes will improve the user experience when viewing the active trades tables on smaller devices.
